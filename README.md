# Vertical Scaling Robot

## Brief
An autonomous glass(vertical) scaling robot with voice recognition and sanitation capabilities.

## Purpose
This is the current project for Tau Beta Pi California Eta for member participation in an extra curricular activity.

## Tasks
This is simply a very brief description of what actions the sub-teams can accomplish

* Create Makefile
* Use NodeJS terminal to communicate with the I2C, actuators, accelerometer, DOF
* C programmers use the SJSUOne Board libraries to activate sensors
* Raspberry Pi programming
* Data sub-team: potential usage of storing .hex files and other information (PHP, MySQL, MariaDB)
* Machine Learning: Computer vision, obstacle recognition, readjustment if the robot falls, etc'

> Not all of these tasks will probably be sought after
> Main focus is Raspberry Pi, SJSUOne Board, and NodeJS

## Components/Programs
| Name | Usage |
| ---- | ----- |
| Makefile | GNU Make for compiling extraneous code (the ones that won't work in Eclipse etc) |
| NodeJS | Using the terminal to communicate directly with the board |
| Raspberry Pi | Microcontroller for the robot |
| SJSUOne Board | Has sensor libraries, accelerometer, SPI, I2C, and more |
